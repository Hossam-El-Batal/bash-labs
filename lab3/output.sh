# 1- n1 and n2 are initialized as integers
# 2- both n1 and n2 got assigned a value of 1
# 3- in the while loop: we check if n1 is eq n2 if true we go to the do statement
# 4- n2=$n1+1 so n2 will be equal to 2;
# 5- print value of n1 which is 1
# 6- if n1 > n2 we break out of the loop which will not happen as 1 > 2 => is false
# 7- n1=$n1+1=1+1=2
# 8- prints value of n2
# 9- at the end of the loop n1 will become equal to n2 so this could be an infinite while loop
